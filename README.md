For static comp two, I flexed my flex-box muscles (but didn't flex the whole body). The task was to render a comp that held the spirt of the initial card based UI, but allowed some freedom in color selection and topic. I really love food, so I pursued food as my topic. Check out issues for the images of comparing the two!
